# Mercury
###The first PHP REST CRUD API Builder of the Earth!

Mercury is a software package consisting of a PHP application able to provide REST API for CRUD operations, which are build upon configurations, and an AngularJS Web Application, called Mercury Framework Configuration, which is a User Interface to do easily the Mercury Configuration.

Mercury was built having in mind the **CCR concept**, which means **C***onnect* - your database(s), **C***onfigure* - your Model(s), Router(s), Controller(s), etc, and **R***un*, which means that, for CRUD operations, you have not to write a single piece of code - doing the configurations in Mercury, it will make available for you the REST Services you need(and if you need some very specific REST service to work joined with the standard CRUD ones, Mercury offer a way to you build them, since you respect some simple rules).
